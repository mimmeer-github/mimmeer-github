# Hello! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to mimmeer-github, yes... yes... I know I have a billion accounts. *(well, not anymore thanks to me deleting them all)*

But at the time **2FA** was *very* annoying - Chrome never remembered my passwords or 2FA stuff.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
Ok, firstly, how should I put it....... I am even *far* into Web Development now.
I am into Python, MicroPython, but most of my programming power is in C# - but I still don't get why it's pronounced "C-Sharp".

UPDATE: Now I've started with C#!

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
I am currently tring to learn:
- WinRT + C++
- *how* to write better C
- *even* more ASM
- C++ *(difficulty: Extreme Super Hot ðŸŒ¶)*

But anyways, time for my ASM coding break *(sarcastic - ASM is not a break in any form)*

```asm
mov ah, 0x0e
mov al, 'C'
int 0x10
mov al, 'o'
int 0x10
int 0x10
mov al, 'l'
int 0x10
mov al, '!'
int 0x10
```
```bash
make
qemu-system-i386 -fda /dist/os.img
```
QEMU says `Cool!`  *(from my own assembly code)*

## ðŸš€ My Progress
Here is a peek into my progression across this year.
