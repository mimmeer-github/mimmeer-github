# Hello! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to mimmeer-github, yes... yes... I know I have a billion accounts. *(well, not anymore thanks to me deleting them all)* But I DON'T NEED 2FA!!!!

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
Ok, firstly, how should I put it....... I am even *far* into Web Development now (as of October 2024).
I am into Python, MicroPython, but mostly into C# - but I still don't get why it's pronounced "C-Sharp".

UPDATE: Now I've started with C#!

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
I am currently tring to learn WinRT + C++, how to write better C, get further into ASM, and leap into C++.

```asm
mov ah, 0x0e
mov al, 'C'
int 0x10
mov al, 'o'
int 0x10
int 0x10
mov al, 'l'
int 0x10
mov al, '!'
int 0x10
```
```bash
make
qemu-system-i386 -fda /dist/os.img
```
QEMU says `Cool!`  *(from my own assembly code)*
